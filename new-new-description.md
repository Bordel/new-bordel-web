Things to sync-on on the call on Saturday:
1) Should we call it a hackerspace? Or makerspace? Or community hub? I was thinking that "hackerspace" sounds maybe too technical oriented, which if we also want to attract (do we?) non-tech people more into the art, etc., the name "hackerspace" can discourage then?.

2) How much to describe the physical location? Should we make some photos that we could use for the web when we will checkout the space one more time on Monday?

3) Where to put the video that Martin will make?

4) Go through the rooms in the space, what we can put there, what ranges of actions we can do there, etc. Make something specific and some plan of what should be in each room.

5) What exactly we will be providing/doing in the "art" part.


# Bordel Hackerspace
## Transforming Chaos into Shared Creations

## What We Are, Why We Exist, and Our Vision
Bordel is a community hackerspace for hackers, makers, artists, and anyone who embraces (peaceful/productive) chaos, creativity or technology. 

Originally opened in Paralelni Polis, after three years of building community, organizing workshops, hackathons, art projects and raves, we are moving to a new independent space in Prague.

Our vision is to create a space that connects technology and art, space where individuals can come together to create, hack, learn, innovate, meet like-minded individuals and build a community.

We aim to create an environment where individuals can come together to hack, create, learn, and innovate. Our values are rooted in open source principles, fostering culture of sharing and cooperation.

## Support Our Mission
As we transition to our new location, we're seeking financial support for the start. Bordel is non-profit collective. By participating in our loan initiative, you can help us build this space while still receiving annual percentage rate (APR) on your money. Although the APR might be lower than other investment options, your contribution will directly support the growth of a community-focused hub for creativity and technology.

If you believe in the importance of collaboration and open-source principles, we invite you to lend your support.

## A Space for Everyone
Bordel Hackerspace is designed to be versatile and welcoming, catering to a variety of activities, including:

- Co-working Spaces: Comfortable areas with stable tables for everyone looking to get things done.
- Makerspace: Fully equipped with tools for various projects — 3D printers, soldering stations, and more.
- Community Bar: Offering Mate, Kombucha, and smoothies — all donations help support the space.
- Audio Setup: Featuring speakers, a DJ controller, synths, and equipment for casual jams and events.
- Workshops and Meetups: An open area for community gatherings and workshops, whether public or private.

We operate on a do-ocracy principle, meaning that everyone’s input is valued. We want to hear your ideas on how you’d like to utilize this space.

(TODO here we should probably add the photos of the space we want to buy?)
