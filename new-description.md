Bordel hackerspace is opening up in a new place! We are looking for people that could help us by being a lenders on our loan! APR might be lower than what you can achieve, but if you want to support world hackers. free open source software, this might be the great way of doing so while still getting some APR on your funds.

(TODO should we elaborate more on "who" we means by hacker? so people can imagine that it's more various)
(TODO should we mention membership? and also call to donate or join us?)
(TODO put here in the text some more details about the physical location?)
(Should we mention open source principles and that we follow them?)

Bordel is a small community hackerspace originally opened in Paralelni Polis. After 3 years of succesfully building
community, organizing workshops, hackatons and raves, we are moving to a new independent space.

Prague has a vibrant community which resonates with Bordel Hackerspace values and mission. Project is only
starting and we are looking for fellow minded indviduals interested in joining our efforts.

(TODO check if is fine put "artists" directly to the text below)
Bordel provides a community space for hackers, makers, artists and everybody who likes to embrace chaos. Specifically, the space should provide:
- Coworking with stable and flexible tables for anyone looking for a chill space to hack from
- Makerspace providing necessary tools for all kinds projects, 3D printers, soldering, etc
- Bar to serve Mate, Kombucha and other drinks + doing smoothies (maybe we can remove this => for donations to support the space)
- Audio setup with speakers, sub, DJ controller, synths and other kinds of equipment for jams and raves
- Space for community meetups and workshops, open to public or private events
- Anything else you'd like! It's a doocracy so anything you bring goes. Let us know in the form below how would you like to use the space
(TODO should we also mention it's a space for meeting and encountering similar-minded people?)

Physical space should be built highly modular, thus customizable to a lot of settings/activities.

Combining all of the above, Bordel space creates a unique atmosphere for creativity, hacking and relax. We
welcome everybody from all kinds of communities to join us and use the space.

The governance is based around do-ocracy, therefore anybody willing to contribute ends up deciding what
happens in the space. Especially in this initial phase we want to hear from you, the community, how would
you like to use the space.
