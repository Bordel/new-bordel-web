    <h1>Welcome to BORDEL</h1>
    <h2>Transforming Chaos into Shared Creations</h2>

    <p>
        In it's most basic form, you can see Bordel as a community sanctuary for hackers, makers, artists, and anyone who embraces (peaceful/productive) chaos, creativity or technology.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our vision is to create a space that connects technology and art, an environment where nonconformists can find their tribe to learn and grow together. Bordel welcomes the pathologically curious to come together to create, hack, learn, innovate and build community.
    </p>

    <p>
        BORDEL is not just a physical space but a provocation where creative expression collides in a deliberate chaos. Its core wonders happen when people come together in an environment where open-mindedness, curiosity, being aware and discovery unfold in a playful manner. A place where members open up to question every reality, seek more experiences and knowledge, and share their thoughts with each other.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a world that demands specialization, we choose integration. In a culture that rewards conformity, we celebrate divergence. In times that push for acceleration, we create space for reflection.
    </p>

    <p>
        Step beyond the boundaries of what you know. Discover the questions you haven't yet thought to ask. Find your people—not those who mirror your certainties, but those who challenge them with authentic curiosity and genuine care. Come to us not to escape reality, but to create a new one.
    </p>

    <h3>Support Our Mission</h3>

    <p>
        After three years incubating our collective madness at Paralelni Polis, building community, organizing workshops, hackathons, art projects and raves, we are moving to a new independent space in Prague.
    </p>

    <p>
        As we transition to our new location, we're seeking financial support for the start. Bordel is non-profit collective. By participating in our loan initiative, you can help us build this space while still receiving annual percentage rate (APR) on your money. Although the APR might be lower than other investment options, your contribution will directly support the growth of a community-focused hub for creativity and technology.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you believe in the importance of collaboration and open-source principles, we invite you to lend your support.
